This is a flask web application that was created to utilize a machine learning sentiment classification model.  
A data set consisting of 500,000 Amazon product reviews was used to fine tune a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
Following training, the model had an accuracy rate of 93% on a test set.  A K-means model was also created with 15 clusters to 
analyze the data set with various visualizations.
